#Deployment Instructions#

1.) Install Java. Make sure JAVA_HOME env var is set to the root of your jdk. You need the jdk, a jre only will not suffice.

2.) Install tomcat. I used tomcat 6. Download the core distribution from the apache website as a tar or zip. Set CATALINA_HOME to the root of your tomcat installation.

3.) Inside the root of your tomcat installation add a directory named Databases.

4.) Extract misc/dbDemo.zip into the Databases directory created above.

5.) copy misc/derby.jar into $CATALINA_HOME/lib

6.) open $CATALINA_HOME/conf/catalina.properties and add the following line.
    derby.system.home = 'path to Databases directory created in step (3.)'

7.) replcace $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml with misc/server.xml

8.) run ant deploy in the root of the repo

9.) start tomcat by running startup.sh in $CATALINA_HOME/bin
